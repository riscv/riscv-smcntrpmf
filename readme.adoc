====
Cycle & Instret Privilege Mode Filtering (Smcntrpmf) has been merged into the Privileged Specification.  Please log any issues against the link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual[RISC-V ISA Manual] repository.

= Cycle & Instret Privilege Mode Filtering Architecture Extension

Smcntrpmf extension extends the RISC-V Privileged ISA to support privilege mode filtering for the cycle and instret counters.  (‘Sm’ for privileged M-mode extension, ‘cntr’ because it extends the 'Zicntr' extension, ‘pmf’ for Privilege Mode Filtering).  This extension depends on the Zicntr extension.

== Building the Document

=== Prerequisites

To build the document, you'll need the following tools installed on your system:

* Make
* asciiDoctor-pdf, asciidoctor-bibtex, asciidoctor-diagram and asciidoctor-mathematical
* Docker

=== Clonning the Repository

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/riscv/docs-spec-template.git`

=== Building the Documentation

To start the build process, run `cd ./docs-spec-template && make build`.

The Makefile script will check the availability of Docker on your system:

* If Docker is available, the documentation will be built inside a Docker container using the image riscvintl/riscv-docs-base-container-image:latest. This ensures a consistent build environment across different systems.
* If Docker is not available, the documentation will be built directly on your system using the installed tools.

The documentation is generated from the AsciiDoctor source files in your project. The primary source file is specified by the `HEADER_SOURCE` variable in the Makefile.

The build process utilizes several options, including theming and font settings, and generates a PDF document as output.

=== Cleaning up

To clean up the generated files, run `make clean`. This will remove the generated PDF file.

== Versioning

The `VERSION` variable is used to specify the revision number for the generated documentation. The default revision number is "v0.0.0".

== Customization

You can customize the build process by modifying the following variables in the Makefile:

* `DATE`: Specifies the revision date for the generated documentation. The default value is the current date.
* `REVMARK`: Specifies the revision remark for the generated documentation. The default value is "Draft".
* `PDF_RESULT`: Specifies the name of the output PDF file.
* `DOCKER_RUN`: Defines the Docker run command used when Docker is available.
